<h1> Hi i'm Chidinma Idonor<br/></h1>

I am a Systems Software Engineer with expertise in embedded systems, Deep learning, computer architecture, and industrial automation. Skilled in TensorFlow, Python, C/C++, CUDA, Arduino, and microcontroller development, I design and deploy real-time control systems, GPU-accelerated workflows, and hardware-software integrated solutions. Experienced with PLC/SCADA integration, edge computing, and high-performance embedded platforms, I also mentor students in digital logic and embedded system design. Beyond engineering, I serve as a Senate Member at the University of Tulsa and volunteer as a STEM mentor, blending technical innovation with community leadership.
